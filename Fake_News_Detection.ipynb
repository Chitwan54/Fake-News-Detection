And, as Shelton noted in a tweet Monday, \"It changed my life forever.\"  Richie was 24 when he died in a car accident in the Sheltons\\' home state of Oklahoma.

Still, the two brothers had bonded despite the age difference; both shared a love of country music. \"His bedroom was right across the hallway from mine when I was little,\" Blake said in that interview. \"And he was listening to Hank Williams, Jr. or Waylon, Lynyrd Skynyrd or Bob Seeger.
